For this project i have used the "https://api.openweathermap.org" api to get the sunrise/sunset data. 
The api key is "bf948622be1db3b84e3748981fd38e27" (it's a free key so it has limited uses).
If the key doesn't work anymore, go to the link above, sign in / create account, go to "my api keys" and generate a new one. 
It might take a few hours for the new key to work.
